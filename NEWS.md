# OneSampleMR 0.1.5

* Replaced dots checking with rlang instead of the ellipsis package (thanks @olivroy).

# OneSampleMR 0.1.4

* Add `CITATION` file

* Tweak formatting of code in helpfile examples and vignettes

* Add subsection to README about GNU Fortran requirement for old versions of the **gmm** package on macOS

* Bumped the minimum required version of R to be 4.1.0. This is because of the same requirement in **pbkrtest**, which is a dependency of **car** which is a dependency of **ivreg**

* Bumped version of **roxygen2** used to create the package documentation

* Made use of ellipsis `...` in several function definitions safer using the **ellipsis** package

* Bumped required version of R to 4.3.0 because the **Matrix** package, which is a dependency of **ivreg** now requires R 4.4.0. CRAN retain a binary version of **Matrix** 1.6-5 for the previous release of R, and so the minimum version of R can be 4.3.0 rather than 4.4.0.

# OneSampleMR 0.1.3

* Update **roxygen2** version used to generate documentation

* Reduce the number of functions imported from other packages

# OneSampleMR 0.1.2

* Make use of packages in Suggests list conditional on their availability

* Remove **ivtools** from Suggests due to the current failure of its **ahaz** dependency package to build on 3 of the CRAN Linux sub-architectures

# OneSampleMR 0.1.1

* Fix an issue causing an `R CMD check` note in R 4.2.0

# OneSampleMR 0.1.0

* Initial submission to CRAN
